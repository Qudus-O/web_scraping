# Web Scraping 
Utilize the Y Combinator API to perform data scraping with the Beautiful Soup library in Python. This process involves extracting valuable information, including the textual content from article tags, the corresponding article links, and the number of upvotes each article has received.

Once the data has been collected, transform the lists into a structured DataFrame using the pandas library. This step will facilitate more efficient analysis and manipulation of the data for further insights.

*Required Libraries:*
- *Beautiful Soup:* For parsing HTML and XML documents to extract data.
- *Requests:* To handle HTTP requests and interact with the Y Combinator API.
- *Pandas:* To organize the extracted data into DataFrames for analysis.
